# ECE 588 - Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning

## 📚 Course Description
ECE 588 provides a comprehensive introduction to the design of high-performance and energy-efficient AI systems. The course bridges the gap between machine learning algorithms and hardware implementations by exploring the full stack: from neural network architectures to logic-level and RTL design on modern computing platforms.

Students will gain hands-on experience with hardware/software co-design techniques for accelerating deep learning workloads on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Key emphasis is placed on design trade-offs related to performance, power, and area.
